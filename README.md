# AdaBoost_Explorations

The output of the other learning algorithms ('weak learners') is combined into a weighted sum that represents the final
output of the boosted classifier. AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent weak learners are tweaked in favor of 
those instances misclassified by previous classifiers.
